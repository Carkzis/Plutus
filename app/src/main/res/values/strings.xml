        There are a few tools here to help with pension administration related stuff, and I hope you
        find it useful in some form or another.  However, before you read further (or alternatively,
        click back and start playing with the tools) it must be emphasised that you should not use
        these when making financial decisions, they have not been checked by professionals (e.g.
        pension consultants or actuaries).\n\n
        <b>This app should be used as a guide only.</b>\n\n
        The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Retail Price Index (RPI) data is obtained
        from the Office for National Statistics website, and these revaluation calculations are
        reliant on them. Additional, the calculation of revaluation figures and pension commencement
        lump sums are subject to change, with this app using the HMRC rules in place as at August 2021.\n\n
        <u>PCLS Calculator</u>\n
        Enter the full pension you have calculated, along with the commutation factor in place
        and any defined contribution or AVC funds which the Scheme rules allow to be combined with
        the defined benefits. The latter field can be left blank.\n
        A number of benefit options will then be provided, however it should be noted that Schemes
        may offer more or less options than those shown. The calculator also only takes into account
        a single commutation factor, and does not account for any restrictions on the amount of tax
        free cash that can be taken.\n\n
        <u>Date Calculator</u>\n
        Click on the text entry boxes to bring up the calendars dialogs, and choose the
        start and end dates, making sure the end date is after the start date (it won\'t count
        backwards!).  You will then be given the duration between the two dates in various units of
        time.  It should be noted that the end date is always included in the calculation.
        \n\n
        <u>Revaluation Calculator</u>\n
        As per the date calculator, enter the start and end dates, and the revaluation rates will
        be calculator for CPI, RPI and fixed rate Guaranteed Minimum Pension.  If this is your first
        time, the app will attempt to download the CPI and RPI data from the ONS website.  You can then
        attempt the calculation again.\n\n
        The calculator will only calculate the revaluation rate where the relevant rate is held in
        memory.  Data is downloaded whenever you try to calculate a revaluation rate, or when you
        access the relevant revaluation information pages in the app.
        To calculate the revaluation rate ending in a certain year, that year must be a maximum
        of one year after the latest September CPI or RPI in memory (i.e. to calculate the CPI revaluation
        rate when the end date is on 1 May 2022, you will need the September 2021 CPI figure in memory,
        which would normally be available in November 2021).\n\n
        If the start date is prior to 6 April 1978, the start date for the fixed GMP revaluation
        calculations will be treated as 6 April 1978, as this is when GMP was introduced.\n\n
        If the start date is prior to 1 January 1986, the CPI and RPI rates will be set to 1.0 as
        revaluation rates are not applied in these instances.\n\n
        If the start date is prior to 1 January 2009, the CPI and RPI max 2.5% rates will consider
        the start date to be 1 January 2009.\n\n
        <u>Inflation Information</u>\n
        There is various information here, with all the CPI, RPI, and their 12-month percentages
        downloaded from ons.gov.uk. The information is received from the following links:\n\n
        CPI:\n https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/timeseries/d7bt/mm23/data\n\n
        CPI 12-Month Percentages:\n
        https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/timeseries/d7g7/mm23/data \n\n

        CPI 12-Month Percentages:\n
        https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/timeseries/czbh/mm23/data \n\n
        There are also the fixed GMP rates, however these are added manually so many not be up to date.\n\n

        the app, or any other apps currently under development!\n\n</string>
